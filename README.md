# 2D Robot Navigation Simulation

A simple 2D robot navigation simulation using **Pygame** and **A* algorithm**. The robot finds the shortest path from a start to a goal position on a grid while avoiding obstacles. Users can also click on grid cells to add or remove obstacles dynamically.

## Features

- Grid-based environment for navigation.
- Interactive: toggle obstacles by clicking on grid cells.
- Robot moves step-by-step using **A* pathfinding**.
- Visual simulation using **Pygame**.
- Adjustable grid size and cell size.
